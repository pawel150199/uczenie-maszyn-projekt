# Main idea of this experiment

Main idea this experiment is check if algorithm which will take image created from text data will better perform than traditional text prediction models.
To do that new class which implements algorithm which translate text to image has been created. Algorithm used to prediction  is convolutional neural network. Convolution window allows to get the context of each sentence and this might be an advantage.

Proposed vectorization methods to compare:
* BagOfWords
* Word2Vec
* Doc2Vec
* TF-IDF

## Experiment
Vectorization methods will be compared to each other
